# Project 4: Train a Smartcab How to Drive
This project exercises the material covered in Unit 4 of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s Machine Learning Engineer [nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). Unit 4 is an introduction to **reinforcement learning**, and in this project, reinforcement learning is used to train a car to drive in a 2-dimensional gridworld.

This project uses Python 2.7 and the [pygame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html) library.
